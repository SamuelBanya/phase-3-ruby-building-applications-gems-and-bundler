# Set up Bundler here following the instructions in the README
# NOTE: This next step prevents us from having to list every single required Gem individually
# since it forces 'Bundler' to utilize the related 'Gemfile' for the project accordingly:
require "bundler/setup"
Bundler.require(:default, :development)
